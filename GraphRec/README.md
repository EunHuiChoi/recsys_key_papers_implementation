# GraphRec: Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation

This project is to a slight modification of the official implementation of the paper:

[**<u>Wenqi Fan</u>**] (https://wenqifan03.github.io), Yao Ma , Qing Li, Yuan He, Eric Zhao, Jiliang Tang, and Dawei Yin. [Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07243.pdf). 
In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 2019. 
Preprint[https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07243]

## TODO

- Refactor the code for model extension
- Train and test the model on datasets other than Epinions and Ciao
- Test PyTorch 2.0 `.compile()` feature
